# Task

## Animations challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build a simple react web app using the themoviedb.org API.

## Problem:

Build a UI that lets a user search for a movie and display the results in a list. When clicking on a list item, a page showing some details about the movie should be displayed. Everything else is up to you.

When you receive the search results, we want this animation sequence for the first screen:
1. Movie item 1 slides in from left
2. Once in position, image for item 1 fades in
3. Repeat step 1 & 2 for each item in the movie list
4. Once you've animated in all list items, pulse in the movie release date for each cardHere is a wireframe example of what is expected:
